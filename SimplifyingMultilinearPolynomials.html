    <title>Simplifying multilinear polynomials</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>When we attended middle school were asked to simplify mathematical expressions like "3x-yx+2xy-x" (or usually
        bigger), and that was easy-peasy ("2x+xy"). But tell that to your pc and we'll see!

        Write a function: simplify, that takes a string in input, representing a multilinear non-constant polynomial in
        integers coefficients (like "3x-zx+2xy-x"), and returns another string as output where the same expression has
        been simplified in the following way ( -> means application of simplify):

        All possible sums and subtraction of equivalent monomials ("xy==yx") has been done, e.g.:
        "cb+cba" -> "bc+abc", "2xy-yx" -> "xy", "-a+5ab+3a-c-2a" -> "-c+5ab"


        All monomials appears in order of increasing number of variables, e.g.:
        "-abc+3a+2ac" -> "3a+2ac-abc", "xyz-xz" -> "-xz+xyz"

        If two monomials have the same number of variables, they appears in lexicographic order, e.g.:
        "a+ca-ab" -> "a-ab+ac", "xzy+zby" ->"byz+xyz"

        There is no leading + sign if the first coefficient is positive, e.g.:
        "-y+x" -> "x-y", but no restrictions for -: "y-x" ->"-x+y"</p>

        function simplify(poly) {
            const tmpObj = {};
            let str = '';

            if (/^\d?\p{Ll}+/iu.test(poly)) {
                poly = "+" + poly;
            }

            const regExp = /([+-]\d*?)(\p{Ll}+)/iug;
            const results = poly.matchAll(regExp);


            for (let result of results) {
                let number = result[1] === "+" ? +1 : Number(result[1]);
                let variable = result[2].split('').sort().join('');

                tmpObj[variable] = tmpObj[variable] ? tmpObj[variable] + number : number;
            }

            Object.keys(tmpObj).sort((a, b) => {
                if (a.length < b.length) return -1;
                if (a.length > b.length) return +1;
                return a.localeCompare(b);
            }).forEach((key, ind) => {
                switch (tmpObj[key]) {
                    case 0:
                        break;
                    case -1:
                        str += `-` + key;
                        break;
                    case +1:
                        str += str.length === 0 ? key : `+` + key;
                        break;
                    case (tmpObj[key] > 0):
                        str += str.length === 0 ? key : `+` + key;
                }
                if (tmpObj[key] != 0) {
                    str += `${tmpObj[key] > 0 && str.length !== 0 ? `+${tmpObj[key]}` : tmpObj[key]}` + key;
                }
            });

            return str;
        }

        console.log(simplify('6x-7xyda+10zch-5x'));
